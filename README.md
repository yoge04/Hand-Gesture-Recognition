# Hand Gesture Recognition üñêÔ∏è

## Overview

This project implements a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** using **Mediapipe** and **OpenCV**. The system processes webcam input to detect and classify hand gestures by analyzing key hand landmarks.

## Features

- **Real-time gesture detection**: Detects hand gestures using webcam feed.
- **Mediapipe Hands API**: Utilizes the **Mediapipe** library for precise detection of hand landmarks.
- **Gesture Visualization**: Displays the recognized gesture on the video feed for easy visualization.

## Supported Gestures

The system can recognize a variety of hand gestures, including:

- Hand gestures detected via hand landmarks.
- **Real-time updates** on the current gesture as you interact.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Mediapipe
- OpenCV

### Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hand-Gesture-Recognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

    ```bash
    python gesture_recognition.py
    ```

4. **Press 'q'** to quit the video stream.

## Applications

- **Sign language recognition**: Helps in understanding and interpreting sign language gestures.
- **Interactive UIs**: Can be used for controlling interfaces through gestures.
- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Gaming**: Gesture controls for immersive experiences.
